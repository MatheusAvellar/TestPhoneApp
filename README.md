# HTML5 Test App on Windows Phone


Testing HTML5 on Windows Phone; Nothing really exciting

So it turns out I can't get the Windows Phone Emulator to work on my oldie W7; Therefore, I mostly can't see what's going on in XML applications, the whole click and drag thing, it's all just trial and errror. And that sucks.
Recently, I've found out I could make applications with HTML5, which brings some ease to the whole thing; So these are my first pokes at that. Hurray.

See, I told you, it's really nothing cool, it's just a test thing.
